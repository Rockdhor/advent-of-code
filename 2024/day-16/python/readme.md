Probably the slowest program so far? 
I 100% can make this faster by simply using a nicer pathfinding algo yet I decided to go with DFS since I've been using it this whole time.
Obviously a mistake. Still, the job got done and I kinda like the fact that there's a few heuristics you can apply to make DFS go faster, I simply added a check to discard paths that arrived at a previously navigated node with a much higher new cost.

Might clean up at some point or restart with a faster approach. It got the job done regardless!
